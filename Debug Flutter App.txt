You need to debug and enhance the provided Flutter app code to address the following issues: 
1. The app currently plays an alert sound whenever it is opened, regardless of the presence of a disaster nearby. Modify it so that the alert sound is triggered only when there is a disaster within a 50 km radius of the user's tracked location.
2. Ensure that when a city is searched, an alert message should only be displayed if there is a disaster in that city.  
3. Fix navigation issues within the app so that users can successfully navigate to other pages.  
4. Ensure continuous tracking of the user's latitude and longitude in `main.dart`. 

Please provide updated and corrected Flutter code that addresses all these points with clear comments explaining the changes made. 

# Steps to Complete the Task
1. Review the existing `main.dart` file for the current location tracking implementation.
2. Update the alert sound logic to check for nearby disasters based on user location.
3. Modify the city search functionality to check against disaster occurrences before displaying alerts.
4. Debug the navigation logic and ensure proper page transitions work as intended.
5. Test the code to ensure that alerts only sound and display when applicable.

# Output Format
- Provide the complete corrected code in a Markdown code block. Make sure the code is formatted correctly and includes comments for clarity.
